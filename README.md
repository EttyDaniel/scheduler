# Interview Scheduler

Description : 
Scheduler is a React project which allows users to add, cancel and edit appointments.
Each appointment creation is set with a day, a time, a student's name and an interviewer's name.
Each day holds 5 spots total and our app shows the spots left for each day.

Here is a snap shot of the app's view on the browser :
